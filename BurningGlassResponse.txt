The burning glass data in itself is no surprise to me, most IT fields are dependant on multiplpe systems working in harmony with eachother and communcation between developers and IT specialist is how this is done. This means anyone with direct experience working in team orientated environment especially ones focused towards solving problems will have a much easier time getting into the field of IT. I feel I already have a large majority of the more essential skills like problem solving, communication, organisational skills and writing from my own experiences and that this will set me up to one day get the role that I want.
