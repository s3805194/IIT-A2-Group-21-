<h3>
        Jennelle Roberts
</h3>

<p>
          Jennelle is also originally from Western Sydney, but now living in Melbourne. The second child of 5, Jennelle is used to noise, differing opinions and nerds.  The whole family are nerds made up of scientists, psychologists and IT professionals.  
<br>
<br>
          Jennelle has a 9 year old daughter who is autistic.  So Jennelle is always up for a chat about diversity advocacy, neurodivergence acceptance and aliens.  Aliens are a big topic at the Roberts house.  
<br>
<br>
          Jennelle loves to make things fit into lists and tables and as she continued through her career, she realised that this way of organising things meant that data was something that came naturally.  She currently works as a Data Analyst for a volume residential builder focusing on Material, Procurement and Costing Data.
