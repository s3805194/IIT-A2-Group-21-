<h3>
        Kyle Francis
</h3>

<p>
          Kyle was born and bred in Brisbane.  He is in fact, still there.  Kyle grew up in a family that loved to be on the cutting edge of technology.  So IT was a second nature for him that saw him develop a love of computer games and hardware. He would love to be involved in troubleshooting and repair as well as the development of application software. 
<br>
<br>
          Kyle’s other loves is for all the cats.  We are pretty sure that Kyle has never met a cat he doesn’t love.  He has his own cat Braum who is named after a League of Legends character.  Braum (The heart of the Freljord) has a wicked moustache, and some of his abilities are to propel freezing ice from his shield as well as become Un-Breakable.  All good qualities for a cat. 
<br>
<br>
         Kyle has also represented Australia, not once, but twice, at the NASA hosted Space Settlement Design Competition.  He is still not sure if he is going to Mars after the initial 2030 mission.
